    <h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2>
    <p>
        JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[6] often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the
        ECMAScript specification.[7] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has
        curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[8] JavaScript enables
        interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it for
        client-side page behavior,[9] and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.
        It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard
        data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM). However, the language itself does not include any
        input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, as the host environment (usually a web
        browser) provides those APIs.
    </p>
    <p>
        JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now embedded in some servers, usually
        via Node.js. They are also embedded in a variety of applications created with frameworks such as Electron and
        Cordova.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective
        standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
